    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><span id="英语四级翻译真题汇总-2016-20246">英语四级翻译真题汇总 (2016-2024.6)</span></h2><h3><span id="2024年6月四级翻译">2024年6月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套四合院">第一套：四合院</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>四合院（siheyuan）是中国一种传统的住宅建筑，其特点是房屋建造在一个院子的四周，将院子合围在中间。四合院通常冬暖夏凉，环境舒适，尤其适合大家庭居住。四合院在中国各地有多种类型，其中以北京的四合院最为典型。如今，随着现代城市的发展，传统的四合院已逐渐减少，但因其独特的建筑风格，四合院对中国文化的传承和中国历史的研究具有重要意义。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Siheyuan is a kind of traditional Chinese residential building, characterized by houses built around a courtyard, enclosing the courtyard in the middle. Siheyuan is usually warm in winter and cool in summer, offering a comfortable environment, especially suitable for large families to live in. There are many types of siheyuan in different parts of China, of which the most typical one is in Beijing. Nowadays, with the development of modern cities, the number of traditional siheyuan has gradually decreased, but because of its unique architectural style, siheyuan is of great significance to the inheritance of Chinese culture and the study of Chinese history.</p><h4><span id="第二套农历">第二套：农历</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>农历（the lunar calendar）起源于数千年前的中国，根据太阳和月亮的运行规律制定。长期以来，农历在农业生产和人们日常生活中发挥着重要作用。古人依据农历记录日期、安排农活，以便最有效地利用自然资源和气候条件，提高农作物的产量和质量。中国的春节、中秋节等传统节日的日期都基于农历。农历是中国传统文化的重要组成部分，当今依然广为使用。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The lunar calendar, which originated in China thousands of years ago, was formulated based on the movements of the sun and the moon. For a long time, the lunar calendar has played an important role in agricultural production and people’s daily lives. Ancient people recorded dates and arranged farm work according to the lunar calendar in order to make the most efficient use of natural resources and climatic conditions to improve the yield and quality of crops. The Chinese Spring Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival and other traditional festivals are based on the lunar calendar. It is an important component of traditional Chinese culture and is still widely used today.</p><h4><span id="第三套福字">第三套：福字</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>汉语中的“福”字（the character fu）表示幸福和好运，是中国传统文化中最常用的吉祥（auspicious）符号之一。人们通常将一个大大的福字写在红纸上，寓意期盼家庭幸福、社会安定、国家昌盛。春节贴福字是民间由来已久的习俗。为了欢庆春节，家家户户都会将福字贴在门上或墙上，表达对幸福生活的向往、对美好未来的期待。人们有时还将福字倒过来贴，表示幸福已到、好运已到。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The Chinese character “fu”, signifying happiness and good luck, is one of the most commonly used auspicious symbols in traditional Chinese culture. People usually write a big character of fu on red paper, which means that they look forward to family happiness, social stability and national prosperity. Posting the character of fu during the Spring Festival is a long-standing folk custom. In order to celebrate the Spring Festival, every family will put the character of fu on the doors or walls to express the yearning for a happy life and the expectation for a better future. People sometimes put the character of fu upside down, indicating that happiness and good luck have arrived.</p><h3><span id="2023年12月四级翻译">2023年12月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="人民健康饮食">人民健康饮食</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>中国政府十分重视人民的健康饮食（diet）。通过大力提倡健康饮食，人们对合理营养增进健康的重要性有了更加深刻的认识。“吃得安全、吃得营养、吃得健康”是人民对美好生活的基本需要，是提升人民幸福感的必然要求，也为食品产业的发展提供了新机遇。目前，各级政府都在采取多种举措确保人民饮食健康，推进健康中国的建设。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The Chinese government attaches great importance to the health and diet of its people. By strongly advocating healthy eating, people have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of proper nutrition in enhancing their well-being. “Eating safely, eating nutritiously, and eating healthily” are the basic needs of the people for a better life. It is an inevitable requirement to enhance people’s sense of happiness and also provides new opportunities for the development of the food industry. Currently, governments at all levels are taking various measures to ensure the health of people’s diets and promote the construction of a Healthy China.</p><h4><span id="人民饮食">人民饮食</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>改革开放以来，中国人的饮食（diet）发生了显著变化。过去由于经济落后，食品种类有限、数量不足，人们仅仅满足于吃得饱。如今中国经济快速发展，食品不仅更加丰富多样，质量也大幅提高。随着生活水平不断提升，人们对饮食的要求越来越高，更加注重吃得营养健康。因此，目前市场上推出的低脂、低糖、有机食品受到人们的普遍欢迎。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Since the launch of the reform and opening-up, the Chinese people’s diet has undergone significant changes. In the past, due to economic backwardness, there was limited variety and insufficient quantity of food, and people were merely satisfied with having enough to eat. Nowadays, with rapid economic development in China, not only has the variety of food become more abundant, but the quality has also greatly improved. As living standards continue to rise, people have higher demands for their diet and pay more attention to eating nutritiously and healthily. Therefore, the low-fat, low-sugar, and organic foods introduced in the market are widely welcomed by people.</p><h4><span id="饮食与物流行业">饮食与物流行业</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>改革开放以来，中国人民生活水平不断提高，这在人们的饮食（diet）变化上得到充分体现。如今，人们不再满足于吃得饱，而是追求吃得更加安全、更加营养、更加健康，食物也愈来愈丰富多样，不再限于本地的农产品。物流业（logistics industry）的发展使人们很容易品尝到全国各地的特产。毫无疑问，食品质量与饮食结构的改善为增进人们健康提供了有力的保障。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Since the reform and opening up, the living standards of the Chinese people have been improving continuously, which has been fully reflected in the changes in people’s diets. Nowadays, people are no longer satisfied with simply being full, but they pursue eating in a safer, more nutritious and healthier way. Food options have become increasingly diverse and are no longer limited to locally grown agricultural products. The development of the logistics industry has made it easy for people to enjoy specialties from all over the country. There is no doubt that the improvement of food quality and dietary structure has provided strong guarantees for enhancing people’s health.</p><h3><span id="2023年6月四级翻译">2023年6月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="终身教育">终身教育</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>中国越来越重视终身教育，发展继续教育是构建终身教育体系的有效途径。高校作为人才培养的基地，拥有先进的教学理念和优越的教学资源，理应成为继续教育的办学主体。因此，近年来许多高校适应社会需求，加强与用人单位沟通，努力探索一条符合中国国情的继续教育发展新路，以使继续教育在国家发展战略中发挥更大的作用。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>China attaches more and more importance to lifelong education, and the development of continuing education is an effective way to build a lifelong education system. As the base for talent cultivation, universities have advanced teaching concepts and superior teaching resources, so they should become the main providers of continuing education. Therefore, in recent years, a number of universities have been trying to explore a new path for developing continuing education that suits China’s specific conditions by catering to social needs and strengthening communications with employers, so that continuing education can play a greater role in the national development strategy.</p><h4><span id="高等教育">高等教育</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>改革开放40多年以来，中国政府对高等教育越来越重视，高等教育已经进入稳步发展阶段。高校学生总数已接近4,700万人，位居世界第一。随着我国经济的快速发展，人民生活水平不断提高，越来越多的人渴望接受高等教育。我国高校的数量和学科专业持续增加，招生人数逐年上升，教学质量也在不断改进，为更多年轻人创造了接受高等教育的机会。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>For more than 40 years since the reform and opening up policy was adopted, the Chinese government has attached more and more importance to higher education, which has entered a stage of steady development. The total number of university students has reached nearly 47 million, ranking first in the world. With the rapid development of China’s economy and the continuous improvement of Chinese people’s living standards, an increasing number of people are eager to receive higher education. The number of universities and disciplines in China have been on the increase, the number of enrollments is rising year by year, and the teaching quality is improving, creating opportunities for more young people to receive higher education.</p><h4><span id="义务教育">义务教育</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>中国政府一直大力推行义务教育（compulsory education），以使每个儿童都享有受教育的机会。自1986年《义务教育法》生效以来，经过不懈努力，实现了在全国推行义务教育的目标。如今，在中国，儿童年满六周岁开始上小学，从小学到初中一共接受九年义务教育。从2008年秋季学期开始，义务教育阶段学生无须缴纳学费。随着一系列教育改革举措的实施，中国义务教育的质量也有显著提高。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The Chinese government has been vigorously carrying out compulsory education all the time so that every child can have access to education. Since the Compulsory Education Law came into effect in 1986, the government has worked diligently to achieve the goal of making compulsory education available throughout the country. Today, children in China, starting school at the age of six, receive a total of nine years of compulsory education from primary school to junior high school. Since the fall semester of 2008, students during compulsory education don’t have to pay tuition fees. With the implementation of a series of educational reform measures, the quality of China’s compulsory education has also been significantly improved.</p><h3><span id="2023年3月四级翻译">2023年3月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套自驾游">第一套：自驾游</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>随着生活水平的提高，更多人开始加入到自驾游的行列之中。自驾游者既可驾驶自家车也可借车或租车出游。司机可能是车主或结伴出游者。自驾游与传统的组团旅游不同，它能够更好地满足旅游者的个性化需求，使他们更好地享受旅游过程。自驾游尤其受到年轻出游者的欢迎。年轻人追求独立自由的生活，而自驾游恰好满足了他们的这一需求。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>With the improvement of living standards, more people begin to join the ranks of self-driving tours. Self-driving tourists can either drive their own cars, or borrow or rent a car. The driver may be the owner of the car or the traveling companion. Different from a traditional group tour, a self-driving tour can better meet the personalized needs of tourists and enable them to better enjoy the travel. Self-driving tours are especially popular with young travelers. Young people pursue an independent and free life, and a self-driving tour just meets their needs.</p><h4><span id="第二套乡村旅游">第二套：乡村旅游</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>近年来，越来越多的城市居民为农村的田园风光所吸引，利用节假日到乡村旅游。他们住在农民家中，品尝具有当地风味的农家饭菜。有些游客还参与采摘瓜果等活动，亲身感受收获的喜悦。乡村旅游能够有效地帮助游客舒缓压力，放松心情，增进身心健康。实际上，这种旅游形式不仅能使城市游客受益，同时也能够增加农民的收入，促进农村经济发展。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>In recent years, a growing number of urban residents are attracted by the rural idyllic scenery and travel to the countryside during their holidays. They live in farmers’ homes and taste farmhouse food with local flavor. Some tourists also take part in activities such as picking fruits to feel the joy of harvest themselves. Rural tourism can effectively help tourists relieve stress, get relaxed and improve their physical and mental health. In fact, this form of tourism can not only benefit urban tourists, but also increase farmers’ income and promote the development of rural economy.</p><h4><span id="第三套自助旅游">第三套：自助旅游</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>近年来，越来越多的年轻人喜爱各种形式的自助旅游。许多自助旅游者选择徒步或骑自行车出游。他们自己设计路线，自带帐篷、厨具以及其他必备的生活用品。在旅途中，自助旅游者经常能够发现一些新的美丽景点，但有时也会遇见意想不到的困难或突发事件。游客在旅行中拥抱自然、欣赏美景，同时也增强了自己克服困难的勇气和野外生存的能力。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>In recent years, more and more young people are fond of various forms of self-help tourism. Many self-help tourists choose to travel on foot or by bicycle. They design their own routes, bring their own tents, kitchenware and other daily necessities. During the journey, self-help tourists can often find some new beautiful scenic spots, but sometimes they can also encounter unexpected difficulties or emergencies. Tourists embrace nature and enjoy the beautiful scenery during their travels while they strengthen their courage to overcome difficulties and the ability to survive in the wild.</p><h3><span id="2022年12月四级翻译">2022年12月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套立秋">第一套：立秋</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>在中国农历中，立秋（Start of Autumn）意味着夏天的结束和秋天的开始。立秋带来的首先是天气的变化，气温逐渐下降。人们看到树叶开始变黄飘落时，知道秋天已经来临，这就是所谓的“一叶知秋”。但此时酷热的天气并未完全结束，高温通常还会持续一段时间，被称为“秋老虎”。立秋对农民意义重大，这时各种秋季作物迅速生长、开始成熟，收获的季节即将到来。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Start of autumn means the end of summer and the beginning of autumn in the Chinese lunar calendar. The first thing that comes with Start of Autumn is the change of weather - the gradual drop of temperature. People know that autumn has arrived when they see the leaves begin to turn yellow and fall which is called “A falling leaf heralds autumn”. But at this time, the hot weather is not completely over, and the high temperature usually lasts for a period of time, which is known as “afterheat”. Start of Autumn is of great significance to farmers, during which a variety of autumn crops grow rapidly and begin to mature, and the harvest season is approaching.</p><h4><span id="第二套立春">第二套：立春</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>立春（Start of Spring）在中国农历中表示春天的开始。立春之后，白天变得更长，天气也愈发温暖，万物开始复苏，大地充满生机。人们常说“一年之计在于春”，农民在这个时节开始播种，为全年的丰收打下基础。中国人早在三千年前就已开始在立春这一天举行庆祝活动。数百年来，迎春一直是民间的重要习俗。在春暖花开的日子里，人们常常外出游玩，欣赏春天的美景。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Start of Spring represents the beginning of spring in the Chinese lunar calendar. After Start of Spring, the days become longer, the weather gets warmer, everything begins to recover, and the earth is full of vitality. It is often said that “The whole year’s work depends on a good start in spring” and farmers start planting seeds at this time to lay the foundation for a good harvest throughout the whole year. As early as 3,000 years ago, Chinese people have been holding celebrations on this day. Welcoming spring has been an important folk custom for hundreds of years. In the warm spring days with flowers blossoming, people often go for an outing and enjoy the beautiful scenery of spring.</p><h4><span id="第三套冬至">第三套：冬至</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>冬至（Winter Solstice）是全年白昼最短、黑夜最长的一天，标志着一年中最寒冷时节的开始。冬至过后，气温越来越低，人们的户外活动逐渐减少。农民地里活儿不多，主要忙于灌溉系统的维护和农作物的防冻，同时为来年春天播种做准备。</p><p>中国人历来很重视冬至，许多地方都把冬至当作一个节日，庆祝方式各地不尽相同。北方人有冬至吃饺子的习俗，南方人有冬至吃汤圆的传统。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Winter Solstice is the day with the shortest daytime and the longest nighttime, marking the beginning of the coldest time of the year. After Winter Solstice, as the temperature gets colder, people’s outdoor activities gradually decrease. Without much work in the field, farmers are mainly busy with the maintenance of the irrigation system and the protection of crops from freezing as well as the preparation for planting in the coming spring.</p><p>The Chinese people have always been attaching great importance to Winter Solstice, which is regarded as a festival in many places and celebrated in different ways. On Winter Solstice, northerners have the custom of eating jiaozi, while southerners have the tradition of eating tangyuan.</p><h3><span id="2022年9月四级翻译">2022年9月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套戏曲">第一套：戏曲</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>戏曲是一种中国传统的艺术形式，可以追溯到唐朝。中国戏曲吸引观众的一大特色是其独具风格的脸谱（facial painting）。脸谱代表不同角色的性格和命运。观众通过观察脸谱能够更好地理解这些角色的故事。欣赏戏曲是中国人特别是老年人的一大乐趣。为了吸引更多的年轻观众，传统戏曲正在不断地发展和创新。如今，越来越多的外国观众也喜欢中国戏曲。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Chinese opera belongs to the traditional Chinese art, which can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty. One of the features of Chinese opera that attracts audiences is its unique face painting. Different face paintings symbolize different characters and their destinies.

Nowadays, with the development of China’s economy and the improvement of people’s living standards, more and more Chinese people, including many farmers and migrant workers, can travel by air. They can fly to all major cities, and many other cities are also planning to build airports. Air services continue to improve, and there are often cheap flights. So in recent years, the number of people choosing to travel by air during holidays has been increasing.</p><h4><span id="第二套公交车出行">第二套：公交车出行</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>公交车曾是中国人出行的主要交通工具。近年来，由于私家车数量不断增多，城市的交通问题越来越严重。许多城市为了鼓励更多人乘坐公交车出行，一直在努力改善公交车的服务质量。车辆的设施不断更新，车速也有了显著提高。然而，公交车的票价却依然相当低廉。现在，在大多数城市，许多当地老年市民都可以免费乘坐公交车。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Buses used to be the main means of transportation for the Chinese people.

In some cities, passengers can use a transportation card or mobile phone to take the subway. Many local elderly citizens can also take the subway for free.</p><h3><span id="2017年12月四级翻译">2017年12月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套泰山">第一套：泰山</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>泰山位于山东省西部。海拔1500余米，方圆约400平方公里。泰山不仅雄伟壮观，而且是一座历史文化名山，过去3000多年一直是人们前往朝拜的地方。据记载，共有72位帝王曾来此游览。许多作家到泰山获取灵感，写诗作文，艺术家也来此绘画。山上因此留下了许许多多的文物古迹。泰山如今已成为中国一处主要的旅游景点。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Mount Tai is situated in the western Shandong Province at a height of about 1500 meters with a coverage of about 400 square kilometers. Mount Tai is not only magnificent in landscape but also is a famous historical and cultural mountain, which was a place of worship in the past 3000 years. According to the record, a total of 72 emperors came visiting the Mount Tai. And many writers came to it for inspiration for their poems and writings and artists for their paintings. Therefore, there left a lot of cultural relics. Now Mount Tai has become one of the main scenic spots in China.</p><h4><span id="第二套华山">第二套：华山</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>华山位于华阴市，距西安120公里。华山是秦岭的一部分，秦岭不仅分割陕南与陕北，也分隔华南与华北。与从前人们常去朝拜的泰山不同，华山过去很少有人光临，因为上山的道路极其危险。然而，希望长寿的人却经常上山，因为山上生长着许多草药，特别是一些稀有的药草。自上世纪90年代安装缆车以来，参观人数大大增加。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Huashan (Mount Hua) is situated in Huayin City, 120 kilometers away from Xi’an. It is part of the Qinling Mountains, which divides not only Southern and Northern Shaanxi, but also South and North China. Unlike Taishan, which became a popular place of pilgrimage, Huashan was not well visited in the past because it is dangerous for the climbers to reach its summit. Huashan was also an important place frequented by immortality seekers, as many herbs grow there especially some rare ones. Since the installation of the cable cars in the 1990s, the number of visitors has increased significantly.</p><h4><span id="第三套黄山">第三套：黄山</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>黄山位于安徽省南部。它风景独特，尤以其日出和云海著称。要欣赏大山的宏伟壮丽，通常得向上看。但要欣赏黄山美景，得向下看。黄山的湿润气候有利于茶树生成，是中国主要产茶地之一。这里还有许多温泉，其泉水有助于防治皮肤病。黄山是中国主要旅游目的地之一，也是摄影和传统国画最受欢迎的主题。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>Huangshan (Yellow Mountain) is located in southern Anhui Province. The area is well known for its unique scenery, especially sunrise and sea of clouds. To enjoy the magnificence of a mountain, you have to look upwards in most cases. To enjoy Huangshan, however, you’ve got to look downward.

In addition, Huangshan has multiple hot springs which help prevent and cure skin illness. Huangshan is one of China’s major tourist destinations and the most frequent subject of photography and traditional Chinese painting.</p><h3><span id="2017年6月四级翻译">2017年6月四级翻译</span></h3><h4><span id="第一套黄河">第一套：黄河</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>黄河是亚洲第三、世界第六长的河流。“黄”这个字描述的是其河水浑浊的颜色。黄河发源于青海，流经九个省份，最后注入渤海。黄河是中国赖以生存的几条河流之一。黄河流域（river basin）是中国古代文明的诞生地，也是中国早期历史上最繁荣的地区。然而，由于极具破坏力的洪水频发，黄河曾造成多次灾害。在过去几十年里，政府采取了各种措施防止灾害发生。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The Yellow River is the third-longest in Asia and the sixth-longest in the world. “Yellow” describes the color of the muddy river. The river originates in Qinghai, runs through nine provinces before it empties into the Bohai Sea. The Yellow River is one of the several rivers that sustain life and livelihood in China. The river basin is the cradle of China’s ancient civilization and was once the most prosperous region in early history of China. However, the Yellow River had triggered many disasters due to frequent catastrophic floods. As such, over the past several decades, the Chinese government has taken a host of steps to prevent such disasters.</p><h4><span id="第二套长江">第二套：长江</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>长江是亚洲最长、世界上第三长的河流。长江流经多种不同的生态系统，是诸多濒危物种的栖息地，灌溉了中国五分之一的土地。长江流域（river basin）居住着三分之一的人口。长江在中国历史、文化和经济上起着很大的作用。长江三角洲（delta）产出多达 $20%$ 的中国国民生产总值。几千年来，长江一直被用于供水、运输和工业生产。长江上还坐落着世界最大的水电站。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>The Yangtze River is the longest in Asia and the third longest in the world. The river, which flows through varied ecosystems along its passage, offers habitats for many endangered species and provides irrigation for 1/5 of China’s land. The Yangtze River basin is home to 1/3 of China’s population. The river plays a very important role in China historically, culturally and economically. The Yangtze River Delta contributes up to $20%$ of China’s GDP. For millennia, the Yangtze River has been used for water supply, shipment and industrial activities.

Red can be found everywhere during Chinese Spring Festival and other joyous occasions. Cashes are often put in red envelopes and sent to family members or close friends as gifts. The popularity of red in China can also be attributed to the fact that people associate it with the Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party. However, red does not signify good luck and joy all the time in that the name of the dead used to be written in red. Thus it is regarded as an offense to write the names of Chinese people in red ink.</p><h4><span id="第二套白色">第二套：白色</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>随着中国的改革开放，如今很多年轻人都喜欢举行西式婚礼。新娘在婚礼上穿着白色婚纱，因为白色被认为是纯洁的象征。然而，在中国传统文化中，白色经常是葬礼上使用的颜色。因此务必记住，白花一定不要用作祝人康复的礼物，尤其不要送给老年人或危重病人。同样，礼金也不能装在白色的信封里，而要装在红色的信封里。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>With China’s reform and opening up, nowadays quite a number of youngsters would like to celebrate their weddings in western style. The bride wears a white wedding dress at the ceremony, as white is regarded as a symbol of purity. However, in traditional Chinese culture, white is a color that is often used in funerals. That’s why it’s necessary to keep in mind that white flowers must not be gifts for patients, especially not for the elders or critically ill patients. Similarly, the cash gift should not be packed in a white envelope, but in a red one instead.</p><h4><span id="第三套黄色">第三套：黄色</span></h4><p><strong>原文：</strong></p><p>在中国文化中，黄颜色是一种很重要的颜色，因为它具有独特的象征意义。在封建（feudal）社会中，它象征统治者的权力和权威。那时，黄色是专为皇帝使用的颜色，皇家宫殿全部漆成黄色，皇袍总是黄色的，而普通老百姓是禁止穿黄色衣服的。在中国，黄色也是收获的象征。秋天庄稼成熟时，田野变得一片金黄。人们兴高采烈，庆祝丰收。</p><p><strong>译文：</strong></p><p>In Chinese culture, yellow is a color occupying a fairly prominent position, which is endowed with unique symbolic significance.

介绍：</p><blockquote><ol><li>提供加速链接（核心）</li><li>支持批量下载、文件夹下载、Aria2、IDM下载</li></ol></blockquote><p>主流方法：</p><blockquote><ol><li>伪pandown，配合加速链接可不限速（推荐使用）</li><li>浏览器安装Speedownload脚本，配合加速链接可不限速（缺点：不支持文件夹、下载任务数最大为6）</li></ol></blockquote><p>这里仅介绍 「伪pandown配合加速链接」这个方法。</p><p><strong>第一步：获取加速链接</strong></p><p>Speedownload提供的加速链接有两种：</p><blockquote><ol><li>免费：每日都需要换一个加速链接、一个加速链接可下载100个文件、每个文件不大于5G</li><li>付费：5元获得一个加速链接、一个加速链接顶30天且每日可下载500个文件、限制单文件大小5G</li></ol></blockquote><p>就小帅来看，倘若你需要长期批量下载文件，选择付费相比其它软件而言是超级划算的。</p><p><img

src="https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/gms2020/BlogPicture/img/image-20230128000930634.png"></p><p><strong>第三步：重启 伪pandown即可满速下载</strong> (PS：下载前需要先登录账号，为最大可能保证账号的安全，请使用手机扫码登录，下载完毕后退出登录账号)</p><p><img

伪PanDownload如出一辙，基于原PanDownload魔改而成。</p><p>特点：</p><blockquote><ol><li>加速链接以口令形式实现(需要做任务免费获取)</li><li>口令更新频繁，不适合长期使用</li></ol></blockquote><p><img
